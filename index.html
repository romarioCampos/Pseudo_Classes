        <h1>Cork returns to where it started for Milestone match</h1>

        <p>Burnley midfielder makes 200th PL appearance at Craven Cottage, having made his debut at the same ground</p>

        <p>There was symmetry for Jack Cork as he celebrated his 200th appearance in the Premier League with a Milestone
            award.</p>

        <p>The Burnley midfielder reached the landmark in the 4-2 defeat at Fulham last weekend.</p>

        <p>Coincidentally, the 29-year-old made his Premier League debut for Burnley at Craven Cottage in February 2010,
            while on loan from Chelsea.</p>

        <p>Since then he has reached the double century thanks also to spells at Southampton and Swansea City.</p>
